# Currency Converter

## Description

Utilizing TDD, we wrote the CurrencyTest suite to create the Currency and CurrencyConverter objects.
Once all of our tests were passing with flying colors, we created the GoatMoneyMachine so that our currency converter would work with user input.

## Directions

Run the file goat_money_machine.rb, and it will prompt you to enter the amount of cash you have on hand.  You may then select from our list of exchange values to determine your new amount.

## Observations

We were so excited to try out the GoatMoneyMachine, we wrote it without writing a test suite.  Then, when we ran into problems, we had to run it several different ways to check what was going on.  So, we learned through actual experience that while it may seem like extra work to create the tests, they actually do make things easier.
